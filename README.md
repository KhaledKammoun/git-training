# git-training

This repository is created for learning and practicing Git and GitHub commands. It is a safe space to try out different Git operations without affecting any main projects.

## Purpose

- Learn basic Git commands: `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `clone`, etc.
- Practice branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.
- Get familiar with pull requests and collaborating with others.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-training.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository:**
   ```bash
   cd git-training
   ```
3. **Create a new branch for your changes:**
   Note: To avoid conflicts, it is recommended to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

   ```

4. **Make your changes and commit them:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   Note: You can also use the command :git commit -am "Your commit message" to add and commit changes in one step, but this only works for files that have already been tracked by Git (i.e., files that have been previously added to the repository).
   ```
